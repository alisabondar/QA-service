# E-Commerce Backend Revamp: Questions and Answers Microservice

Welcome to our revamped backend API service for our e-commerce site! Our team of two talented software engineers undertook a significant transformation to transition from a monolithic structure to a modern, service-oriented microservices architecture. This transition was designed to not only support our current system but to amplify its capabilities for the future.

## Highlights

**Database Optimization**  
Strategically chose PostgreSQL for its horizontal scaling capabilities. Reduced average response time by 99.9% through query indexing.
**Deployment & Load Balanding**  
Deployed the microservice with two AWS EC2 instances alongside Nginx as a load balancer, resulting in a remarkable 91% improvement in response time and a 0% error rate during stress testing.
